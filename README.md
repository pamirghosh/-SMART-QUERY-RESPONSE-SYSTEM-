# SMART QUERY RESPONSE SYSTEM

## Overview

The **SMART QUERY RESPONSE SYSTEM** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide accurate and relevant answers to user queries related to specific services. It uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to enhance response accuracy by leveraging a vector database (Faiss) for context retrieval and a large language model (LLM) to generate precise answers.

## Features

- **Accurate Responses**: Provides users with relevant answers based on their specific queries about services.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines a vector database (Faiss) with a large language model (Google PaLM) to improve the quality and relevance of the answers.
- **Custom Dataset**: Uses a custom-trained dataset to retrieve service-specific context and generate better answers.
- **Scalable & Efficient**: Built with scalability in mind, making it suitable for handling a variety of service-related queries.

## Technologies Used

- **Google PaLM**: Large Language Model for generating accurate responses.
- **LangChain**: A framework for building and managing the pipeline.
- **Faiss vectorDB**: A vector database for storing and retrieving relevant context to augment responses.
- **Python**: Main programming language for implementation.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries (`langchain`, `faiss`, etc.)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-query-response-system.git
    cd smart-query-response-system
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your environment variables and credentials for Google PaLM API.

4. Run the system:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the chatbot by running the main script (`main.py`).
2. Interact with the chatbot by typing your service-related queries.
3. The system will retrieve relevant context from the vector database and generate an accurate response using the LLM.
